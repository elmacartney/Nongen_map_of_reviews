abstract={Obesity is a major health condition that affects millions worldwide. There is an increased interest in understanding the adverse outcomes associated with obesogenic diets. A multitude of studies have investigated the transgenerational impacts of maternal and parental obesogenic diets on subsequent generations of offspring, but results have largely been mixed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on rodent studies to elucidate how obesogenic diets impact the mean and variance of grand-offspring traits. Our study focused on transgenerational effects (i.e., F2 and F3 generations) in one-off and multigenerational exposure studies. From 33 included articles, we obtained 407 effect sizes representing pairwise comparisons of control and treatment grand-offspring groups pertaining to measures of body weight, adiposity, glucose, insulin, leptin, and triglycerides. We found evidence that male and female grand-offspring descended from grandparents exposed to an obesogenic diet displayed phenotypes consistent with metabolic syndrome, especially in cases where the obesogenic diet was continued across generations. Further, we found stronger evidence for the effects of grand-maternal than grand-paternal exposure on grand-offspring traits. A high-fat diet in one-off exposure studies did not seem to impact phenotypic variation, whereas in multigenerational exposure studies it reduced variation in several traits. © 2021 World Obesity Federation},

abstract={Epigenetic inheritance is another piece of the puzzle of nongenetic inheritance, although the prevalence, sources, persistence, and phenotypic consequences of heritable epigenetic marks across taxa remain unclear. We systematically reviewed over 500 studies from the past 5 years to identify trends in the frequency of epigenetic inheritance due to differences in reproductive mode and germline development. Genetic, intrinsic (e.g., disease), and extrinsic (e.g., environmental) factors were identified as sources of epigenetic inheritance, with impacts on phenotype and adaptation depending on environmental predictability. Our review shows that multigenerational persistence of epigenomic patterns is common in both plants and animals, but also highlights many knowledge gaps that remain to be filled. We provide a framework to guide future studies towards understanding the generational persistence and eco-evolutionary significance of epigenomic patterns. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Males and females may experience different effects of early-life adversity on life-long health. One hypothesis is that male foetuses invest more in foetal growth and relatively less in placental growth, and that this makes them susceptible to poor nutrition in utero, particularly if nutrition is reduced part-way through gestation. Objectives: Our objectives were to examine whether (1) food and/ or protein restriction in rats and mice has consistent sex-dependent effects, (2) sex-dependency differs between types of outcomes, and (3) males are more severely affected when restriction starts part-way through gestation. Data sources: PubMed and Web of Science were searched to identify eligible studies. Study eligibility criteria: Eligible studies described controlled experiments that restricted protein or food during gestation in rats or mice, examined physiological traits in offspring from manipulated pregnancies, and tested whether effects differed between males and females. Results: Our search identified 292 articles, of which the full texts of 72 were assessed, and 65 were included for further synthesis. A majority (50) used Wistar or Sprague-Dawley rats and so these were the primary focus. Among studies in which maternal diet was restricted for the duration of gestation, no type of trait was consistently more severely affected in one particular sex, although blood pressure was generally increased in both sexes. Meta-analysis found no difference between sexes in the effect of protein restriction throughout gestation on blood pressure. Among studies restricting food in the latter half of gestation only, there were again few consistent sex-dependent effects, although three studies found blood pressure was increased in males only. Meta-analysis found that food restriction in the second half of gestation increased adult blood pressure in both sexes, with a significantly greater effect in males. Birthweight was consistently reduced in both sexes, a result confirmed by meta-analysis. Conclusions: We found little support for the hypotheses that males are more affected by food and protein restriction, or that effects are particularly severe if nutrition is reduced part-way through gestation. However, less than half of the studies tested for sex by maternal diet interactions to identify sex-dependent effects. As a result, many reported sex-specific effects may be false positives. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Maternal nutrition affects offspring physiology and behavior including susceptibility to mental health-related states. Perinatal high-fat diet (HFD) consumption has been associated with lower levels of serotonin as well as the development of anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in offspring. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effects of maternal HFD during pregnancy and/or lactation on these behaviors and on some aspects of the serotonergic system. Criteria for eligibility included studies of offspring of rodents and non-human primates exposed to HFD at least during pregnancy and/or lactation, offspring that showed outcomes related to anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors and to the serotonergic system. The searches were realized in the LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases. The systematic review protocol was registered on the CAMARADES website. The internal validity was assessed by the SYRCLE risk of bias tool. The Kappa index was used for analyzing agreement among the reviewers. In addition, the PRISMA statement was used to report this systematic review. Sixteen articles were included in this review. Most of which studied HFD prior to mating and during pregnancy and lactation. All studies analyzed outcomes related to emotional behavior; three analyzed outcomes related to serotonin system compounds. Maternal consumption of HFD was found to be associated with an inconsistent pattern of the expression of TPH2 as well as reduced the immunoreactivity of 5-HT in the prefrontal cortex and increased 5-HT1A receptor expression in the dorsal raphe of offspring. An association between an HFD and alterations in emotional behavior was found in most of the studies selected. © 2021 International Society for Developmental Neuroscience},

abstract={Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) during pregnancy has been associated with childhood obesity. Research in which rodent dams have been given high-fat/high-sugar diets has consistently found metabolic alterations in their offspring. However, what remains unclear is the potential impact on the developing fetus of giving sugar in isolation at concentrations similar to SSBs to the mothers. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (Protocol No: 127115 on Prospero) to identify potential relationships between maternal sucrose consumption and metabolic outcomes in offspring of rodent (rat or mouse) models. We analysed studies that provided rodent mothers dams with access to sucrose solutions (8-20% w/v) prior to conception, during pregnancy and/or lactation and that reported offspring outcomes of body weight (BW), body composition and glycaemic control. Following a systematic search of four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus) performed on 15 January 2019, maternal and offspring data from 15 papers were identified for inclusion. Only rat studies were identified. Meta-analyses were performed on standardised mean differences for maternal and offspring BW and fasting glucose levels, with subgroup analyses of strain, sucrose concentration, exposure period and sex of offspring. A bias towards the inclusion of only data from male offspring was identified and this limited interpretation of potential sexually dimorphic outcomes. Maternal sucrose exposure was associated with an increased risk of obesity and poor glucose disposal in adult and aged offspring. © 2021 Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Maternal nutrition is an environmental determinant for offspring growth and development, especially in critical periods. Nutritional imbalances during these phases can promote dysregulations in food intake and feeding preference in offspring, affecting body composition. The aim of this review is to summarize and discuss the effects of maternal high-fat diet (HFD) on offspring feeding behavior and body composition. A search was performed in the PUBMED, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and LILACS databases. Inclusion criteria were studies in rodents whose mothers were submitted to HFD that assessed outcomes of food or caloric intake on offspring and food preference associated or not with body weight or body composition analysis. At the end of the search, 17 articles with the proposed characteristics were included. In these studies, 15 articles manipulated diet during pregnancy and lactation, 1 during pregnancy only, and 1 during lactation only. Maternal exposure to a HFD leads to increased food intake, increased preference for HFDs, and earlier food independence in offspring. The offspring from HFD mothers present low birthweight but become heavier into adulthood. In addition, these animals also exhibited greater fat deposition on white adipose tissue pads. In conclusion, maternal exposure to HFD may compromise parameters in feeding behavior and body composition of offspring, impairing the health from conception until adulthood. © Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease 2020.},

abstract={This systematic review examined the effects of paternal exposure to a high-fat diet on the likelihood of offspring developing health consequences, including metabolic conditions. While the connection between a mother’s diet and offspring health has been well established, our understanding of whether offspring health is affected by a father’s diet remains limited. This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) recommendations. The PubMed, Scopus, and Embase electronic databases were searched using combinations of the MESH terms: obesogenic diet, high-fat diet, cafeteria diet, paternal diet, parental diet, programming, paternal effects, and paternal programming. Sixteen studies were selected after assessing articles for eligibility criteria. The main outcomes concerning offspring health related to metabolic disorders. The offspring of fathers exposed to a high-fat diet displayed elevated gene expression and serum levels of leptin, decreased gene expression and serum levels of adiponectin, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, changes in the transcriptome of pancreatic islet tissues, increased triglycerides, and increased expression of lipogenic genes. The available evidence suggests that paternal exposure to a high-fat diet may induce harmful effects on the health of offspring. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Background: Although in all sexually reproducing organisms an individual has a mother and a father, non-genetic inheritance has been predominantly studied in mothers. Paternal effects have been far less frequently studied, until recently. In the last 5 years, research on environmentally induced paternal effects has grown rapidly in the number of publications and diversity of topics. Here, we provide an overview of this field using synthesis of evidence (systematic map) and influence (bibliometric analyses). Results: We find that motivations for studies into paternal effects are diverse. For example, from the ecological and evolutionary perspective, paternal effects are of interest as facilitators of response to environmental change and mediators of extended heredity. Medical researchers track how paternal pre-fertilization exposures to factors, such as diet or trauma, influence offspring health. Toxicologists look at the effects of toxins. We compare how these three research guilds design experiments in relation to objects of their studies: fathers, mothers and offspring. We highlight examples of research gaps, which, in turn, lead to future avenues of research. Conclusions: The literature on paternal effects is large and disparate.

abstract={Background: Omega-3 PUFA or methionine (Met) supply during gestation alters offspring physiology. However, the effect of both nutrients on fetal development has not been explored. Our objective was to determine the effects of supplementation of these two nutrients during late gestation on fetal growth, DNA methylation, and mRNA expression of genes associated with the inflammatory response, and DNA methylation. Ewes (n = 5/treatment) were fed from day 100 to 145 of gestation one of the following treatments: 1) basal diet (NS) without fatty acids (FS) or methionine (MS) supplementation; 2) FS (10 g/kg Ca salts, source omega-3 PUFA); 3) MS (1 g/kg rumen protected methionine); and 4) FS and MS (FS-MS). On day 145, ewes were euthanized, and data from dams and fetus was recorded. Placenta (cotyledon), fetal liver, and blood samples were collected. Results: A treatments interaction on fetal liver weight, ewe body weight and body condition score (BCS) was observed; FS-MS were heavier (P < 0.01) than FS and MS, and FS-MS ewes had a better (P = 0.02) BCS than NS. Methionine increased (P = 0.03) ewe plasma glucose concentration. Fetal liver global DNA methylation increased (P < 0.01) in FS and MS. Dietary treatments modify the mRNA relative expression on some of the genes evaluated. In the fetal liver, FS increased (P = 0.04) the mRNA relative expression of arachidonate-5-lipoxygenase-activating-protein and tended to decrease (P = 0.06) methionine-adenosyltransferase-1A. Moreover, MS decreased (P = 0.04) DNA-methyltransferase-1 and tended to decrease (P = 0.08) free-fatty-acid-receptor-1 mRNA relative expression. Furthermore, FS-MS decreased mRNA relative expression of tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha (P = 0.05), peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-delta (P = 0.03) and gamma (P = 0.04), tended to decrease (P ≤ 0.09) interleukin-6, fatty-acid-transport-protein-1, and delta-5-desaturase, and increased adenosylhomocysteinase (P = 0.04) mRNA relative expression. In cotyledon, FS tended to decrease fatty acid binding protein 4 (P = 0.09) mRNA relative expression. Conclusion: Omega-3 PUFA and Met supplementation improves dam’s performance in late gestation, which was positively correlated with an increase in offspring’s liver development. Moreover, FS-MS decreased mRNA relative expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and lipogenic genes, and increased the expression on an enzyme that has an important role in methylation. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Diethyl phthalate (DEP) is widely used in many commercially available products including plastics and personal care products. DEP has generally not been found to share the antiandrogenic mode of action that is common among other types of phthalates, but there is emerging evidence that DEP may be associated with other types of health effects. Objective: To inform chemical risk assessment, we performed a systematic review to identify and characterize outcomes within six broad hazard categories (male reproductive, female reproductive, developmental, liver, kidney, and cancer) following exposure of nonhuman mammalian animals to DEP or its primary metabolite, monoethyl phthalate (MEP). Methods: A literature search was conducted in online scientific databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Toxline, Toxcenter) and Toxic Substances Control Act Submissions, augmented by review of online regulatory sources as well as forward and backward searches. Studies were selected for inclusion using PECO (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome) criteria. Studies were evaluated using criteria defined a priori for reporting quality, risk of bias, and sensitivity using a domain-based approach. Evidence was synthesized by outcome and life stage of exposure, and strength of evidence was summarized into categories of robust, moderate, slight, indeterminate, or compelling evidence of no effect, using a structured framework. Results: Thirty-four experimental studies in animals were included in this analysis. Although no effects on androgen-dependent male reproductive development were observed following gestational exposure to DEP, there was evidence including effects on sperm following peripubertal and adult exposures, and the overall evidence for male reproductive effects was considered moderate. There was moderate evidence that DEP exposure can lead to developmental effects, with the major effect being reduced postnatal growth following gestational or early postnatal exposure; this generally occurred at doses associated with maternal effects, consistent with the observation that DEP is not a potent developmental toxicant. The evidence for liver effects was considered moderate based on consistent changes in relative liver weight at higher dose levels; histopathological and biochemical changes indicative of hepatic effects were also observed, but primarily in studies that had significant concerns for risk of bias and sensitivity. The evidence for female reproductive effects was considered slight based on few reports of statistically significant effects on maternal body weight gain, organ weight changes, and pregnancy outcomes. Evidence for cancer and effects on kidney were judged to be indeterminate based on limited evidence (i.e., a single two-year cancer bioassay) and inconsistent findings, respectively. Conclusions: These results suggest that DEP exposure may induce androgen-independent male reproductive toxicity (i.e., sperm effects) as well as developmental toxicity and hepatic effects, with some evidence of female reproductive toxicity. More research is warranted to fully evaluate these outcomes and strengthen confidence in this database. © 2020},

abstract={The emerging growth of nanotechnology has attracted great attention due to its application in the parasite and intermediate host control. However, the knowledge concerning the mechanism of action (MoA) and toxicity of nanomaterials (NMs) to snails remain unclear. In this context, the present study revised the historical use of snails as experimental models in nanotoxicological studies and summarized the MoA and toxicity of NMs in aquatic and land snails. The data concerning the bioaccumulation, reproductive and transgenerational toxicity, embryotoxicity, genotoxicity and potential molluscicidal activity of NMs were revised. Furthermore, the data about the experimental conditions, such as exposure time, concentrations, cell and tissue-specific responses, snail species and nanoparticle types are discussed. Revised data showed that the toxic effects of NMs were reported for 21 snail species with medical, veterinary and ecological importance. The NM toxicity to snails is dependent on the physical and chemical properties of NMs, as well as their environmental transformation and experimental design. The NM bioaccumulation on snails was related to several toxic effects, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative stress, following by oxidative damage to DNA, lipids and proteins. The NM metabolism in snails remains unknown. Results showed the potential use of NMs in the snail control program. Also, significant research gaps and recommendations for future researches are indicated. The present study confirms that snails are suitable invertebrate model system to assess the nanotoxicity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Environmental enrichment is a widely used experimental manipulation that consistently shows measurable effects on rodent behaviour across the lifespan. This scoping review assesses and thematically summarizes the literature of the past decade concerning the effects of environmental enrichment applied during sensitive developmental periods in rodent mothers and offspring. Maternal behaviours as well as maternal and offspring anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours are considered. Relevant terms were searched across five databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science) and articles were screened with inclusion and exclusion criteria. The remaining articles were thematically analysed. Our results suggest that a greater number of articles reviewed the impacts of environmental enrichment on offspring anxiety-like behaviour (n = 23) rather than on depressive-like behaviour (n = 11) or maternal caregiving behaviour (n = 12). Maternal anxiety- (n = 4) or depressive-like (n = 2) behaviours are not often evaluated for in enrichment studies. The main behavioural tests of anxiety that were reviewed include the elevated plus-maze, the open field test, and the light-dark box whereas those for depression included the forced swim test and the sucrose preference test. Our results yielded mixed findings and significant variation in behavioural responses across all tests. In mothers, trends of increased maternal care behaviours and decreased maternal depressive-like behaviours in enriched mothers were appreciated. Enrichment during the gestational period was identified as pivotal to creating behavioural change in mother subjects. In enriched offspring rodents, a trend towards decreased anxiety-like behaviours was observed most often. Potential confounds inherent in enrichment paradigms and relevant theories of enrichment and their relation to rodent behavioural tests are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Gestational period plays critical role in neuropsychological development. One of the genes that undergoes changes by prenatal stress (PNS) exposure, is the gene coding brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Studies have reported different patterns of change following PNS in BDNF, which emphasizes the complexity of the issue. In this review, systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL databases was performed. Primary searches resulted in 2132 studies and finally 43 studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Transcriptional and epigenetic changes of BDNF gene in the brain were recorded. Decreased or unchanged BDNF total mRNA and BDNF mature protein, with hypermethylation of the coding exons were the most reported changes. However, stress paradigm, gender of the fetus and the day of sacrifice were found to significantly affect the results. Hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are the most vulnerable regions. They can show long lasting and persistent transcriptional and epigenetics changes of BDNF gene following PNS. Further studies evaluating the importance of these findings in humans are essential. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Assessing long-term health effects from a potentially harmful environment is challenging. Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) have become omnipresent in our environment. Individuals may or may not experience clinical health issues from being exposed to the increasing environmental pollution in daily life, but an issue of high concern is that also the non-exposed progeny may encounter consequences of these ancestral exposures. Progress in understanding epigenetic mechanisms opens new perspectives to estimate the risk of man-made EDCs. However, the field of epigenetic toxicology is new and its application in public health or in the understanding of disease etiology is almost non-existent, especially if it concerns future generations. In this review, we investigate the literature on transgenerational inheritance of diseases, published in the past 10 years. We question whether persistent epigenetic changes occur in the male germ line after exposure to synthesized EDCs. Our systematic search led to an inclusion of 43 articles, exploring the effects of commonly used synthetic EDCs, such as plasticizers (phthalates and bisphenol A), pesticides (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, atrazine, vinclozin, methoxychlor), dioxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, such as benzo(a)pyrene). Most studies found transgenerational epigenetic effects, often linked to puberty- or adult-onset diseases, such as testicular or prostate abnormalities, metabolic disorders, behavioral anomalies, and tumor development. The affected epigenetic mechanisms included changes in DNA methylation patterns, transcriptome, and expression of DNA methyltransferases. Studies involved experiments in animal models and none were based on human data. In the future, human studies are needed to confirm animal findings. If not transgenerational, at least intergenerational human studies and studies on EDC-induced epigenetic effects on germ cells could help to understand early processes of inheritance. Next, toxicity tests of new chemicals need a more comprehensive approach before they are introduced on the market. We further point to the relevance of epigenetic toxicity tests in regard to public health of the current population but also of future generations. Finally, this review sheds a light on how the interplay of genetics and epigenetics may explain the current knowledge gap on transgenerational inheritance. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={Scope: The effectiveness of maternal folate in reducing the risk of congenital malformations during pregnancy is well established. However, the role of the paternal folate status is scarcely investigated. The aim of this study is to investigate the evidence of associations between the paternal folate status and sperm quality, sperm epigenome, and pregnancy outcomes. Methods and results: Databases are searched up to December 2017 resulting in 3682 articles, of which 23 are retrieved for full-text assessment. Four out of thirteen human and two out of four animal studies show positive associations between folate concentrations and sperm parameters. An additional meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials in subfertile men shows that the sperm concentration increases (3.54 95% confidence interval (CI) [−1.40 to 8.48]) after 3–6 months of 5 mg folic acid use per day compared to controls. Moreover, two out of two animal and one out of three human studies show significant alterations in the overall methylation of the sperm epigenome. One animal and one human study show associations between low folate intake and an increased risk of congenital malformations. Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis shows evidence of associations between paternal folate status and sperm quality, fertility, congenital malformations, and placental weight. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={The hypothesis that in utero exposures to low levels of trichloroethylene (TCE) may increase the risk of congenital heart defects (CHDs) in offspring remains a subject of substantial controversy within the scientific community due primarily to the reliance on an inconsistent and unreproducible experimental study in rats. To build on previous assessments that have primarily focused on epidemiological and experimental animal studies in developing conclusions, the objective of the current study is to conduct a systematic evaluation of mechanistic data related to in utero exposures to TCE and the development of CHDs. The evidence base was heterogeneous; 79 mechanistic datasets were identified, characterizing endpoints which ranged from molecular to organismal responses in seven species, involving both in vivo and in vitro study designs in mammalian and non-mammalian models. Of these, 24 datasets were considered reliable following critical appraisal using a study quality tool that employs metrics specific to the study type. Subsequent synthesis and integration demonstrated that the available mechanistic data: 1) did not support the potential for CHD hazard in humans, 2) did not support the biological plausibility of a response in humans based on organization via a putative adverse outcome pathway for valvulo-septal cardiac defects, and 3) were not suitable for serving as candidate studies in risk assessment. Findings supportive of an association were generally limited to in ovo chicken studies, in which TCE was administered in high concentration solutions via direct injection. Results of these in ovo studies were difficult to interpret for human health risk assessment given the lack of generalizability of the study models (including dose relevance, species-specific biological differences, variations in the construct of the study design, etc.). When the mechanistic data are integrated with findings from previous evaluations of human and animal evidence streams, the totality of evidence does not support CHDs as a critical effect in TCE human health risk assessment. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: Numerous rodent studies have evaluated the effects of maternal stress (MS) on later in life susceptibility to Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) intermediate phenotypes with varying results. The aim of this study was to quantitatively synthesize the available data on the effects of MS on offspring obesity, estimated indirectly by body mass (BM), body fat (BF) and plasma leptin; systolic blood pressure (SBP); plasma glucose (and insulin) and blood lipid concentrations. Methods: Literature was screened and summary estimates of the effect of MS outcomes were calculated by using random-effects models. Data on the effects of exogenous corticosteroid administration (or inhibition of 11β-HSD2) during pregnancy in rodents was analysed separately to characterize the direct phenotypic effects of prenatal corticosteroid excess (PCE). Results: We conducted 14 separate meta-analyses and synthesized relevant data on outcomes scarcely reported in literature. Both MS and PCE were associated with low birth weight without rapid catch-up growth resulting in decreased body mass later in life. Our analysis also revealed significant and contradictory effects on offspring adiposity. Little evidence was found for effects on glucose metabolism and blood lipids. We identified increased SBP in offspring exposed to PCE; however, there is not enough data to draw any conclusion about effects of MS on SBP. Conclusions: Neonatal weight proved to be decreased in offspring prenatally exposed to stress or corticosteroids, but laboratory rodents in the absence of a challenging environment did not show catch-up growth. The available evidence is inconclusive regarding the effect on adiposity revealing clear methodological and knowledge gaps. This meta-analysis also confirmed a significant positive association between PCE and SBP. Nevertheless, additional studies should address the association with MS. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to summarize the effects of maternal undernutrition or overnutrition during pregnancy on fetal weight and morphometric measurements during pregnancy, at birth, and postnatal period in sheep. After completing the search, selection, and data extraction steps, the measure of effect was generated by the individual comparison of each indicator with the average of the control and treated group (undernutrition or overnutrition) using the DerSimonian and Laird method for random effects. Subgroup analyses were also performed for lambing order, litter size, sex, as well as level, timing, and duration of the intervention. Fetal weight during the first third of pregnancy was not affected by maternal undernutrition or overnutrition. On the other hand, undernutrition in the second and last third of gestation reduces the weight of the lamb both during pregnancy, at birth, and during the postnatal period, requiring at least 120 postnatal days to achieve the same weight as its contemporaries in the control treatment. However, this reduction in weight is not accompanied by reductions in morphometric measurements, demonstrating that the animals were lighter, but of equal size. In overnutrition, there is an increase in fetal weight in the second third of gestation. However, in the last third of the gestational period, there are no differences in fetal weight for the multiparous subgroup, but it was reduced in primiparous ewes. There are no effects of overnutrition on birth weight; however, this result is highly heterogeneous. Thus, maternal nutrition of ewe during pregnancy has effects on fetal and postnatal weight, but not on size. Furthermore, the effects of undernutrition are more homogeneous while overnutrition showed heterogeneous responses. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Little is known about possible effects of maternal non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) consumption on the metabolic health of a child. Animal models of maternal NNS consumption during pregnancy or weaning have yielded widely varying results, and there appears to be no clear consensus on the consequences for offspring body weight, glycaemic control or sweet preference choices. Moreover, heterogeneity in study design has hampered a clear focus for future research relevant to human health. In an effort to bring clarity, we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (protocol no: CRD42018109509) in animal models (rat or mouse) of maternal NNS feeding (compared to water or basal diet) during pre-gestation, pregnancy or lactation. Four databases were searched from inception to 15th September 2018: PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS and Web of Science. We present maternal and offspring data from 24 included studies, which have been quantitatively analysed after study quality assessment, to identify relationships between maternal diet and offspring body weight (BW), feeding behaviour and glycaemic control. In 11 data sets, exposure to NNS reduced maternal BW during pregnancy, with no effect on litter outcomes. Meta-analyses on offspring BW during weaning (1123 offspring) and adulthood (646 offspring) identified small decreases in BW for both sexes. Subgroup analyses revealed reductions in BW of rat, but not mouse models. High dosage appears to be a potential factor for reduced palatability that could influence BW results; however, a lack of reported data limited our ability to confirm. Despite this, and the fact many papers were predisposed to bias, the balance of evidence suggests a maternal NNS diet during pregnancy or lactation did not increase the body weight in offspring. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The adaptive value of transgenerational effects (the ancestor environmental effects on offspring) in changing environments has received much attention in recent years, but the related empirical evidence remains equivocal. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis summarising 139 experimental studies in plants and animals with 1170 effect sizes to investigate the generality of transgenerational effects across taxa, traits, and environmental contexts. It was found that transgenerational effects generally enhanced offspring performance in response to both stressful and benign conditions. The strongest effects are in annual plants and invertebrates, whereas vertebrates appear to benefit mostly under benign conditions, and perennial plants show hardly any transgenerational responses at all. These differences among taxonomic/life-history groups possibly reflect that vertebrates can avoid stressful conditions through their mobility, and longer-lived plants have alternative strategies. In addition to environmental contexts and taxonomic/life-history groups, transgenerational effects also varied among traits and developmental stages of ancestors and offspring, but the effects were similarly strong across three generations of offspring. By way of a more comprehensive data set and a different effect size, our results differ from those of a recent meta-analysis, suggesting that transgenerational effects are widespread, strong and persistent and can substantially impact the responses of plants and animals to changing environments. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS},

abstract={Although mothers influence the traits of their offspring in many ways beyond the transmission of genes, it remains unclear how important such ‘maternal effects’ are to phenotypic differences among individuals. Synthesizing estimates derived from detailed pedigrees, we evaluated the amount of phenotypic variation determined by maternal effects in animal populations. Maternal effects account for half as much phenotypic variation within populations as do additive genetic effects. Maternal effects most greatly affect morphology and phenology but, surprisingly, are not stronger in species with prolonged maternal care than in species without. While maternal effects influence juvenile traits more than adult traits on average, they do not decline across ontogeny for behaviour or physiology, and they do not weaken across the life cycle in species without maternal care. These findings underscore maternal effects as an important source of phenotypic variation and emphasise their potential to affect many ecological and evolutionary processes. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS},

abstract={Maternal undernutrition during pregnancy is prevalent across the globe, and the origins of many chronic diseases can be traced back to in utero conditions. This systematic review considers the current evidence in animal models regarding the relationship between maternal global nutrient restriction during pregnancy and offspring kidney structure and function. CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Scopus were searched to November 2017. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines were followed, and articles were screened by two independent reviewers. Twenty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria: 16 studies were on rats, 9 on sheep, 2 on baboons, and 1 on goats. The majority of the rat studies had maternal global nutrient restriction during pregnancy at 50% of ad libitum while restriction for sheep and baboon studies ranged from 50% to 75%. Because of the heterogeneity of outcome measures and the large variation in the age of offspring at followup, no meta-analysis was possible. Common outcome measures included kidney weight, nephron number, glomerular size, glomerular filtration rate, and creatinine clearance. To date, there have been no studies assessing kidney function in large animal models. Most studies were rated as having a high or unknown risk of bias. The current body of evidence in animals suggests that exposure to maternal global nutrient restriction during pregnancy has detrimental effects on offspring kidney structure and function, such as lower kidney weight, lower nephron endowment, larger glomerular size, and lower glomerular filtration rate. Further long-term followup of studies in large animal models investigating kidney function through to adulthood are warranted. © 2019 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Obesity before and during pregnancy leads to reduced offspring cardiometabolic health. Here, we systematically reviewed animal experimental evidence of maternal obesity before and during pregnancy and offspring anthropometry and cardiometabolic health. We systematically searched Embase and Medline from inception until January 2018. Eligible publications compared offspring of mothers with obesity to mothers with a normal weight. We performed meta-analyses and subgroup analyses. We also examined methodological quality and publication bias. We screened 2543 publications and included 145 publications (N = 21 048 animals, five species). Essential methodological details were not reported in the majority of studies. We found evidence of publication bias for birth weight. Offspring of mothers with obesity had higher body weight (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.76 [95% CI 0.60;0.93]), fat percentage (0.99 [0.64;1.35]), systolic blood pressure (1.33 [0.75;1.91]), triglycerides (0.64 [0.42;0.86], total cholesterol (0.46 [0.18;0.73]), glucose level (0.43 [0.24;0.63]), and insulin level (0.81 [0.61;1.02]) than offspring of control mothers, but similar birth weight. Sex, age, or species did not influence the effect of maternal obesity on offspring's cardiometabolic health. Obesity before and during pregnancy reduces offspring cardiometabolic health in animals. Future intervention studies should investigate whether reducing obesity prior to conception could prevent these detrimental programming effects and improve cardiometabolic health of future generations. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Background: Maternal nutrition during pregnancy has life-long consequences for offspring. However, the effects of maternal overnutrition and/ or obesity on fetal growth remain poorly understood, e.g., it is not clear why birthweight is increased in some obese pregnancies but not in others. Maternal obesity is frequently studied using rodents on high-fat diets, but effects on fetal growth are inconsistent. The purpose of this review is to identify factors that contribute to reduced or increased fetal growth in rodent models of maternal overnutrition. Methods: We searched Web of Science and screened 2173 abstracts and 328 full texts for studies that fed mice or rats diets providing ~ 45% or ~ 60% calories from fat for 3 weeks or more prior to pregnancy. We identified 36 papers matching the search criteria that reported birthweight or fetal weight. Results: Studies that fed 45% fat diets to mice or 60% fat diets to rats generally did not show effects on fetal growth. Feeding a 45% fat diet to rats generally reduced birth and fetal weight. Feeding mice a 60% fat diet for 4-9 weeks prior to pregnancy tended to increase in fetal growth, whereas feeding this diet for a longer period tended to reduce fetal growth. Conclusions: The high-fat diets used most often with rodents do not closely match Western diets and frequently reduce fetal growth, which is not a typical feature of obese human pregnancies. Adoption of standard protocols that more accurately mimic effects on fetal growth observed in obese human pregnancies will improve translational impact in this field. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Biomonitoring studies indicate a trend towards increased human exposure to diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), a replacement for dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Recent reviews have found DIBP to be a male reproductive toxicant, but have not evaluated other hazards of DIBP exposure. Objective: To inform chemical risk assessment, we performed a systematic review to identify and characterize outcomes within six broad hazard categories (male reproductive, female reproductive, developmental, liver, kidney, and cancer) following exposure of nonhuman mammalian animals to DIBP or the primary metabolite, monoisobutyl phthalate (MIBP). Methods: A literature search was conducted in four online scientific databases [PubMed, Web of Science, Toxline, and Toxic Substances Control Act Test Submissions 2.0 (TSCATS2)], and augmented by review of regulatory sources as well as forward and backward searches. Studies were identified for inclusion based on defined PECO (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome) criteria. Studies were evaluated using criteria defined a priori for reporting quality, risk of bias, and sensitivity using a domain-based approach. Evidence was synthesized by outcome and life stage of exposure, and strength of evidence was summarized into categories of robust, moderate, slight, indeterminate, or compelling evidence of no effect, using a structured framework. Results: Nineteen toxicological studies in rats or mice met the inclusion criteria. There was robust evidence that DIBP causes male reproductive toxicity. Male rats and mice exposed to DIBP during gestation had decreased testosterone and adverse effects on sperm or testicular histology, with additional phthalate syndrome effects observed in male rats. There was also evidence of androgen-dependent and -independent male reproductive effects in rats and mice following peripubertal or young adult exposure to DIBP or MIBP, but confidence was reduced because of concerns over risk of bias and sensitivity in the available studies. There was also robust evidence that DIBP causes developmental toxicity; specifically, increased post-implantation loss and decreased pre- and postnatal growth. For other hazards, evidence was limited by the small number of studies, experimental designs that were suboptimal for evaluating outcomes, and study evaluation concerns such as incomplete reporting of methods and results. There was slight evidence for female reproductive toxicity and effects on liver, and indeterminate evidence for effects on kidney and cancer. Conclusion: Results support DIBP as a children's health concern and indicate that male reproductive and developmental toxicities are hazards of DIBP exposure, with some evidence for female reproductive and liver toxicity. Data gaps include the need for more studies on male reproductive effects following postnatal and adult exposure, and studies to characterize potential hormonal mechanisms in females. © 2018},

abstract={Maternal obesity in pregnancy is associated with neurobehavioral problems in the offspring. Establishing causality has been challenging in existing human studies, due to confounding by genetic and postnatal environment. Animal experiments can improve our understanding of this association. This systematic review examined the effects of maternal obesity in pregnancy on offspring neurobehavior in animal models. We included 26 studies (1047 offspring animals). Meta-analyses showed that offspring of obese mothers displayed higher levels of locomotor activity (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.34 [0.10; 0.58]) and anxiety behavior (SMD 0.47 [0.16; 0.79]) than offspring of lean mothers, but similar memory abilities (SMD −0.06 [−0.52; 0.39]). Meta-analysis of learning abilities was not sensible due to heterogeneity. Although the evidence was heterogeneous and the quality of the included studies generally unclear, this systematic review of animal studies indicates an effect of maternal obesity on increased offspring locomotor activity and anxiety, but not on offspring memory performance. These findings may be important from a public health perspective since obesity is rapidly increasing worldwide, and warrant further research. © 2018},

abstract={Adverse early life events are a well-established risk factor for the precipitation of behavioral disorders characterized by anomalies in the dopaminergic system, such as schizophrenia and addiction. The correlation between early life conditions and the dopaminergic system has been causally investigated in more than 90 rodent publications. Here, we tested the validity of the hypothesis that early life stress (ELS) alters dopamine signaling by performing an extensive 3-level mixed effect meta-analysis. We included several ELS models and biochemical indicators of the dopaminergic system in a variety of brain areas, for a total of 1009 comparisons. Contrary to our expectations, only a few comparisons displayed a significant effect. Specifically, the striatal area was the most vulnerable, displaying decreased dopamine precursor and increased metabolites after ELS. To make all data openly accessible, we created MaDEapp (https://osf.io/w25m4/), a tool to explore data of the meta-analysis with the intent to guide future (pre)clinical research and allow power calculations. All in all, ELS induces a few yet robust changes on biochemical indicators of the dopaminergic system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Prenatal exposure to maternal stress is commonly associated with variation in Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA)-axis functioning in offspring. However, the strength or consistency of this response has never been empirically evaluated across vertebrate species. Here we meta-analyzed 114 results from 39 studies across 14 vertebrate species using Bayesian phylogenetic mixed-effects models. We found a positive overall effect of prenatal stress on offspring glucocorticoids (d' = 0.43) though the 95% Highest Posterior Density Interval overlapped with 0 (-0.16-0.95). Meta-regressions of potential moderators highlighted that phylogeny and life history variables predicted relatively little variation in effect size. Experimental studies (d' = 0.64) produced stronger effects than observational ones (d' = -0.01), while prenatal stress affected glucocorticoid recovery following offspring stress exposure more strongly (d' = 0.75) than baseline levels (d' = 0.48) or glucocorticoid peak response (d' = 0.36). These findings are consistent with the argument that HPA-axis sensitivity to prenatal stress is evolutionarily ancient and occurs regardless of a species' overall life history strategy. These effects may therefore be especially important for mediating intra-specific life-history variation. In addition, these findings suggest that animal models of prenatal HPA-axis programming may be appropriate for studying similar effects in humans. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Aims: We assessed the animal and epidemiological data to determine if chloroform exposure causes developmental and/or reproductive toxicity. Results and Discussion: Initial scoping identified developmental toxicity as the primary area of concern. At levels producing maternal toxicity in rats and mice, chloroform caused decrements in fetal weights and associated delays in ossification. In a single mouse inhalation study, exposure to a high concentration of chloroform was associated with small fetuses and increased cleft palate. However, oral exposure of mice to chloroform at a dose 4 times higher was negative for cleft palate; multiple inhalation studies in rats were also negative. Epidemiologic data on low birth weight and small for gestational age were generally equivocal, preventing conclusions from being drawn for humans. The animal data also show evidence of very early (peri-implantation) total litter losses at very high exposure levels. This effect is likely maternally mediated rather than a direct effect on the offspring. Finally, the epidemiologic data indicate a possible association of higher chloroform exposure with lower risk of preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation). Conclusions: The available animal data suggest that exposures lower than those causing maternal toxicity should be without developmental effects in the offspring. Also, most studies in humans rely on group-level geographic exposure data, providing only weak epidemiologic evidence for an association with development outcomes and fail to establish a causal role for chloroform in the induction of adverse developmental outcomes at environmentally relevant concentrations. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Background: An increasing number of reports suggest early life exposures result in adverse effects in offspring who were never directly exposed; this phenomenon is termed “transgenerational inheritance.” Given concern for public health implications for potential effects of exposures transmitted to subsequent generations, it is critical to determine how widespread and robust this phenomenon is and to identify the range of exposures and possible outcomes. Objectives: This scoping report examines the evidence for transgenerational inheritance associated with exposure to a wide range of stressors in humans and animals to identify areas of consistency, uncertainty, data gaps, and to evaluate general risk of bias issues for the transgenerational study design. Methods: A protocol was developed to collect and categorize the literature into a systematic evidence map for transgenerational inheritance by health effects, exposures, and evidence streams following the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) approach for conducting literature-based health assessments. Results: A PubMed search yielded 63,758 unique records from which 257 relevant studies were identified and categorized into a systematic evidence map by evidence streams (46 human and 211 animal), broad health effect categories, and exposures. Data extracted from the individual studies are available in the Health Assessment Workspace Collaborative (HAWC) program. There are relatively few bodies of evidence where multiple studies evaluated the same exposure and the same or similar outcomes. Studies evaluated for risk of bias generally had multiple issues in design or conduct. Conclusions: The evidence mapping illustrated that risk of bias, few studies, and heterogeneity in exposures and endpoints examined present serious limitations to available bodies of evidence for assessing transgenerational effects. Targeted research is suggested to addressed inconsistencies and risk of bias issues identified, and thereby establish more robust bodies of evidence to critically assess transgenerational effects - particularly by adding data on exposure-outcome pairs where there is some evidence (i.e., reproductive, metabolic, and neurological effects). © 2017},

Confidence in the human and animal bodies of evidence was assessed and hazard conclusions reached by integrating evidence streams. The search yielded 6 relevant human studies and 19 animal studies. Meta-analysis of 5 human observational prospective cohort studies showed that increased maternal urinary concentrations of DEHP metabolites were associated with decreased AGD in boys (−4.07 [CI, −6.49 to −1.66] % decrease per log10 rise in DEHP metabolites). Meta-analysis and meta-regression of the 19 experimental animal studies found reduced AGD with DEHP treatment, with a dose-response gradient, and with heterogeneity explained by species and strain. There is a moderate level of evidence from human investigations and a high level of data from animal studies that in utero exposure to DEHP decreases AGD. Based upon the available human and animal evidence, and consideration of mechanistic data, DEHP is presumed to be a reproductive hazard to humans on the basis of effects on AGD. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Across the literature, there is large variation in lamb birth weight responses to changes in the ewe pregnancy nutrition. Much of this heterogeneity has been attributed to several factors inherent to each experiment; however, the relative contribution of these experimental factors has not yet been quantified. This meta-analysis aimed to systematically review the variation in lamb birth weight responses across nutritional studies involving adult multiparous ewes. Effect-sizes for individual studies were estimated using the unbiased estimator Hedges’ g, whereby positive and negative values indicate heavier and lighter treatment lambs vs. controls, respectively. Heterogeneity varied between early-, mid-and late-pregnancy undernutrition studies (I2total [early pregnancy]= 19.90%, I2total [midpregnancy]= 52.10%,I2total [late pregnancy]= 68.70%). The small average effects for early-(0.04, highest posterior density [HPD] interval = −0.22, 0.28) and mid-pregnancy undernutrition (−0.15, HPD interval = −0.35, 0.05) suggest that if farmers anticipate a potential feed shortage, ewes can be allowed to lose weight providing nutrition is resumed to adequate levels later in pregnancy. On the contrary, late-pregnancy undernutrition was associated with a significant decrease in lamb birth weight (−0.72, HPD interval = −0.86, −0.55). Thus, management practices should focus on ensuring adequate nutrition in late pregnancy. Increasing lamb birth weight could be possible by feeding ewes above their pregnancy maintenance requirement (0.23, HPD interval = 0.002, 0.48), though the number of studies is limited and further research is needed. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Background: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has increased in prevalence in the past decade. Studies attempting to identify a specific genetic component have not been able to account for much of the heritability of ADHD, indicating there may be gene-environment interactions underlying the disorder, including early exposure to environmental chemicals. Based on several relevant studies, we chose to examine bisphenol A (BPA) as a possible contributor to ADHD in humans. BPA is a widespread environmental chemical that has been shown to disrupt neurodevelopment in rodents and humans. Objectives: Using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) framework, a systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to determine the relationship between early life exposure to BPA and hyperactivity, a key diagnostic criterion of ADHD. Data sources: Searches of PubMed, Web of Science, and Toxline were completed for all literature to January 1, 2017. Study eligibility criteria: For inclusion, the studies had to publish original data, be in the English language, include a measure of BPA exposure, and assess if BPA exposure affected hyperactive behaviors in mice, rats or humans. Exposure to BPA had to occur at <3 months of age for humans, up to postnatal day 35 for rats and up to postnatal day 40 for mice. Exposure could occur either gestationally (via maternal exposure) or directly to the offspring. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Studies were evaluated using the OHAT risk of bias tool. The effects in humans were assessed qualitatively. For rodents exposed to 20 μg/kg/day BPA, we evaluated the study findings in a random effects meta-analytical model. Results: A review of the literature identified 29 rodent and 3 human studies. A random effects meta-analysis showed significantly increased hyperactivity in male rodents. In humans, early BPA exposure was associated with hyperactivity in boys and girls. Limitations, conclusions, and implications of key findings: We concluded that early life BPA exposure is a presumed human hazard for the development of hyperactivity. Possible limitations of this systematic review include deficiencies in author reporting, exclusion of some literature based on language, and insufficient similarity between human studies. SRs that result in hazard-based conclusions are the first step in assessing and mitigating risks. Given the widespread exposure of BPA and increasing diagnoses of ADHD, we recommend immediate actions to complete such risk analyses and take next steps for the protection of human health. In the meantime, precautionary measures should be taken to reduce exposure in pregnant women, infants and children. The present analysis also discusses potential mechanisms by which BPA affects hyperactivity, and the most effective avenues for future research.

abstract={Diet and immunity are both highly complex processes through which organisms interact with their environment and adapt to variable conditions. Parents that are able to transmit information to their offspring about prevailing environmental conditions have a selective advantage by ‘priming’ the physiology of their offspring. We used a meta-analytic approach to test the effect of parental diet on offspring immune responses. Using the geometric framework for nutrition (a method for analysing diet compositions wherein food nutrient components are expressed as axes in a Cartesian coordinate space) to define dietary manipulations in terms of their energy and macronutrient compositions, we compiled the results of 226 experiments from 38 published papers on the intergenerational effects of diet on immunity, across a range of study species and immunological responses. We observed intergenerational impacts of parental nutrition on a number of offspring immunological processes, including expression of pro-inflammatory biomarkers as well as decreases in anti-inflammatory markers in response to certain parental diets. For example, across our data set as a whole (encompassing several types of dietary manipulation), dietary stress in parents was seen to significantly increase pro-inflammatory cytokine levels measured in offspring (overall d = 0.575). All studies included in our analysis were from experiments in which the offspring were raised on a normal or control diet, so our findings suggest that a nutrition-dependent immune state can be inherited, and that this immune state is maintained in the short term, despite offspring returning to an ‘optimal’ diet. We demonstrate how the geometric framework for nutrition can be used to disentangle the role that different forms of dietary manipulation can have on intergenerational immunity. For example, offspring B-cell responses were significantly decreased when parents were raised on a range of different diets. Similarly, our approach allowed us to show that a parental diet elevated in protein (regardless of energy composition and relative to a control diet) can increase expression of inflammatory markers while decreasing B-cell-associated markers. By conducting a systematic review of the literature, we have identified important gaps that impair our understanding of the intergenerational effects of diet, such as a paucity of experimental studies involving increased protein and decreased energy, and a lack of studies directed at the whole-organism consequences of these processes, such as immune resilience to infection. The results of our analyses inform our understanding of the effects of diet on physiological state across diverse biological fields, including biomedical sciences, maintenance of agricultural breed stock and conservation breeding programs, among others. © 2017 Cambridge Philosophical Society},

abstract={The use of functional amino acids during pregnancy has been linked to improved reproduction in mammals. In this context, arginine is a precursor in the synthesis of numerous molecules, such as nitric oxide and polyamines, which play an important role during reproduction. However, contradictory studies are found in the literature, particularly regarding the amount of supplementation and the period of pregnancy in which it is used. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary arginine supplementation for pregnant sows on foetal development via a systematic review. The search for papers was performed during the month of December 2015, in the databases ISI Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, and SciELO. From a total of 5675 returned studies, only 13 papers were selected after applying selection criteria. Most (47%) of the studies that evaluated the effects of dietary arginine supplementation on foetal development in pigs used 1% arginine. Supplementation was initiated in the first third of pregnancy in 47% of tests, including in both primiparous and multiparous sows. These studies showed positive results for embryo survival and foetal development, evidenced by the increase in placental weight and the number and weight of piglets born alive. Of all evaluated studies, 53% showed benefits on foetal development. It is concluded that supplementing dietary arginine in gestating sows can benefit embryo survival and foetal development. However, to establish a supplementation plan with this amino acid, aspects related to the period of pregnancy, supplementation levels, and source of arginine must be well defined. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Across mammals, prenatal maternal stress (PREMS) affects many aspects of offspring development, including offspring growth. However, how PREMS translates to offspring growth is inconsistent, even within species. To explain the full range of reported effects of prenatal adversity on offspring growth, we propose an integrative hypothesis: developmental constraints and a counteracting adaptive growth plasticity work in opposition to drive PREMS effects on growth. Mothers experiencing adversity reduce maternal investment leading to stunted growth (developmental constraints). Concomitantly, the pace of offspring life history is recalibrated to partly compensate for these developmental constraints (adaptive growth plasticity). Moreover, the relative importance of each process changes across ontogeny with increasing offspring independence. Thus, offspring exposed to PREMS may grow at the same rate as controls during gestation and lactation, but faster after weaning when direct maternal investment has ceased. We tested these predictions with a comparative analysis on the outcomes of 719 studies across 21 mammal species. First, the observed growth changes in response to PREMS varied across offspring developmental periods as predicted. We argue that the observed growth acceleration after weaning is not "catch-up growth," because offspring that were small for age grew slower. Second, only PREMS exposure early during gestation produced adaptive growth plasticity. Our results suggest that PREMS effects benefit the mother's future reproduction and at the same time accelerate offspring growth and possibly maturation and reproductive rate. In this sense, PREMS effects on offspring growth allow mother and offspring to make the best of a bad start.},

abstract={Numerous rodent studies have evaluated the effects of a maternal high-fat diet (HFD) on later in life susceptibility to Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) with varying results. Our aim was to quantitatively synthesize the available data on effects of maternal HFD around gestation on offspring's body mass, body fat, plasma leptin, glucose, insulin, lipids and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Literature was screened and summary estimates of the effect of maternal HFD on outcomes were calculated by using fixed- or random-effects models. 362 effect sizes from 68 studies together with relevant moderators were collected. We found that maternal HFD is statistically associated with higher body fat, body weight, leptin, glucose, insulin and triglycerides levels, together with increased SBP in offspring later in life. Our analysis also revealed non-significant overall effect on offspring's HDL-cholesterol. A main source of variation among studies emerged from rat strain and lard-based diet type. Strain and sex -specific effects on particular data subsets were detected. Recommendations are suggested for future research in the field of developmental programming of the MetS. Despite significant heterogeneity, our meta-analysis confirms that maternal HFD had long-term metabolic effects in offspring. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={The pre-natal period is of critical importance in defining how individuals respond to their environment throughout life. Stress experienced by pregnant females has detrimental effects on offspring behaviour, health and productivity. The sheep (Ovis aries) has been used as a model to inform human studies; however, in a farming context, the consequences for the lamb of stress experienced by the ewe have received less attention. The stressors that pregnant ewes are most frequently exposed to include sub-optimal nutrition and acute and chronic stressors related to husbandry and the environment. This review focuses upon the young sheep, from around 100 days old until adulthood and uses material identified from a systematic survey of the literature relating to production-relevant maternal stressors and lamb outcomes. Overall, the results demonstrated that stressors imposed upon the ewe altered progeny behavioural and physiological responses. However, detailed analysis of the literature shows several deficiencies in the field, as a whole, which greatly limit the ability to draw conclusions as to how welfare may be affected by pre-natal challenges in commercial sheep. These deficiencies included a lack of consistency in response due to the variety of both stressors imposed and responses measured. Key gaps in knowledge include the impact of ewe disease during pregnancy on outcomes for their progeny and more generally how different commercially relevant stressors interact. Furthermore, there is a need to develop a systematic series of behavioural and physiological measures that can be integrated to provide a holistic and practically applicable picture of offspring welfare. © 2017 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.},

Toxicological evidence: PFOA: 12 studies (21 datasets) in mice showed statistically significant lower birth/fetal weights from 5 mg/kg body weight per day. PFOS: most of the 13 studies (19 datasets) showed lower birth/fetal weights following in utero exposure. Epidemiological evidence: Sixteen articles were considered. The pooled LRC for a 1 ng/mL increase in untransformed PFOA (12 studies) in maternal plasma/serum was −12.8 g (95% CI −23.2; 2.4), and −27.1 g (95% CI −50.6; −3.6) for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL PFOA (nine studies). The pooled LRC for untransformed PFOS (eight studies) was −0.92 g (95%CI −3.4; 1.6), and for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL was −46.1(95% CI −80.3; −11.9). No consistent pattern emerged for study location or timing of blood sampling. Conclusions: Epidemiological and toxicological evidence suggests that PFOA and PFOS elicit a decrease in BrthW both in humans and rodents. However, the effective animal extrapolated serum concentrations are 102–103 times higher than those in humans. Thus, there is no quantitative toxicological evidence to support the epidemiological association, thus reducing the biological plausibility of a causal relationship. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Background Adverse effects of prenatal stress or environmental chemical exposures on fetal growth are well described, yet their combined effect remains unclear. Objectives To conduct a systematic review on the combined impact and interaction of prenatal exposure to stress and chemicals on developmental outcomes. Methods We used the first three steps of the Navigation Guide systematic review. We wrote a protocol, performed a robust literature search to identify relevant animal and human studies and extracted data on developmental outcomes. For the most common outcome (fetal growth), we evaluated risk of bias, calculated effect sizes for main effects of individual and combined exposures, and performed a random effects meta-analysis of those studies reporting on odds of low birthweight (LBW) by smoking and socioeconomic status (SES). Results We identified 17 human- and 22 animal-studies of combined chemical and stress exposures and fetal growth. Human studies tended to have a lower risk of bias across nine domains. Generally, we found stronger effects for chemicals than stress, and these exposures were associated with reduced fetal growth in the low-stress group and the association was often greater in high stress groups, with limited evidence of effect modification. We found smoking associated with significantly increased odds of LBW, with a greater effect for high stress (low SES; OR 4.75 (2.46–9.16)) compared to low stress (high SES; OR 1.95 (95% CI 1.53–2.48)). Animal studies generally had a high risk of bias with no significant combined effect or effect modification. Conclusions We found that despite concern for the combined effects of environmental chemicals and stress, this is still an under-studied topic, though limited available human studies indicate chemical exposures exert stronger effects than stress, and this effect is generally larger in the presence of stress.},

abstract={Animal models of maternal high fat diet (HFD) demonstrate perturbed offspring metabolism although the effects differ markedly between models. We assessed studies investigating metabolic parameters in the offspring of HFD fed mothers to identify factors explaining these inter-study differences. A total of 171 papers were identified, which provided data from 6047 offspring. Data were extracted regarding body weight, adiposity, glucose homeostasis and lipidaemia. Information regarding the macronutrient content of diet, species, time point of exposure and gestational weight gain were collected and utilized in meta-regression models to explore predictive factors. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's regression test. Maternal HFD exposure did not affect offspring birthweight but increased weaning weight, final bodyweight, adiposity, triglyceridaemia, cholesterolaemia and insulinaemia in both female and male offspring. Hyperglycaemia was found in female offspring only. Meta-regression analysis identified lactational HFD exposure as a key moderator. The fat content of the diet did not correlate with any outcomes. There was evidence of significant publication bias for all outcomes except birthweight. Maternal HFD exposure was associated with perturbed metabolism in offspring but between studies was not accounted for by dietary constituents, species, strain or maternal gestational weight gain. Specific weaknesses in experimental design predispose many of the results to bias. © 2017 The Authors. Obesity Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of World Obesity Federation},

abstract={Adaptive evolutionary responses are determined by the strength of selection and amount of genetic variation within traits, however, both are known to vary across environmental conditions. As selection is generally expected to be strongest under stressful conditions, understanding how the expression of genetic variation changes across stressful and benign environmental conditions is crucial for predicting the rate of adaptive change. Although theory generally predicts increased genetic variation under stress, previous syntheses of the field have found limited support for this notion. These studies have focused on heritability, which is dependent on other environmentally sensitive, but nongenetic, sources of variation. Here, we aim to complement these studies with a meta-analysis in which we examine changes in coefficient of variation (CV) in maternal, genetic, and residual variances across stressful and benign conditions. Confirming previous analyses, we did not find any clear direction in how heritability changes across stressful and benign conditions. However, when analyzing CV, we found higher genetic and residual variance under highly stressful conditions in life-history traits but not in morphological traits. Our findings are of broad significance to contemporary evolution suggesting that rapid evolutionary adaptive response may be mediated by increased evolutionary potential in stressed populations. © 2017 The Author(s).

abstract={Objectives: describing the effects of maternal supplementation with folic acid (FA) exclusively during gestation on offspring’s liver at later stages in life. Supplementation with FA during gestation has been recommended by the medical society worldwide. The liver has a central role on the substances of metabolism and homeostasis and some studies have shown that a high intake of FA at other periods in life may cause hepatic damage. Methods: a systematic review through which the following databases were consulted: Medline, through platforms of Pubmed, Lilacs and Scielo. The research was performed by keywords such as: “Folic acid”, “Gestation”, “Rat”, “Offspring” and “Liver”. Articles which evaluate the effect of FA consumption during both gestation and lactation were excluded. Results: FA consumption avoids disorders on expression of peroxisome proliferator-acti-vated receptor alpha (PPARα) and glucocorticoid receptor (GccR), its lack did not change enzyme activity of the male offspring’s liver in adulthood. Supplementation with FA during gestation did not change iron hepatic levels or lipid composition, but had an antioxidant effect on it. Conclusions: supplementation with FA at recommended doses did not cause toxic effects and is very likely to avoid deleterious effects in the liver of the offspring regarding the epigenetic level. © 2017, Instituto Materno Infantil Professor Fernando Figueira.

abstract={Maternal nutrition can have long-term effects on offspring morphology, physiology and behaviours. However, it is unclear whether mothers ‘program’ offspring behavioural coping strategy (proactive/reactive) according to the predicted nutritional quality of their future environment. We conducted a systematic review on this topic and meta-analytically synthesized relevant experimental data on mice and rats (46 studies). We included data from experiments where dams were subjected to caloric restriction, protein restriction or overfeeding around gestation and subsequently measured offspring activity, exploration, or anxiety. Overall, little evidence existed for effects of maternal nutrition on the three investigated behavioural traits. The high heterogeneity observed in the data set suggests that maternal programming may sometimes occur. However, because offspring had access to a balanced diet before testing, behaviours may have been reprogrammed. Our results may indicate that reprogrammed behaviours could ameliorate negative effects associated with sub-optimal nutrition in early life. Further, our systematic review revealed clear knowledge gaps and fruitful future research avenues. © 2015 Cambridge Philosophical Society},

abstract={Life-history theory predicts that nutrition influences lifespan owing to tradeoffs between allocating resources to reproduction, growth and repair. Despite occasional reports that early diet has strong effects on lifespan, it is unclear whether this prediction is generally supported by empirical studies. We conducted a meta-analysis across experimental studies manipulating pre- or post-natal diet and measuring longevity. We found no overall effect of early diet on lifespan. We used meta-regression, considering moderator variables based on experimental and life-history traits, to test predictions regarding the strength and direction of effects that could lead to positive or negative effects. Pre-natal diet manipulations reduced lifespan, but there were no effects of later diet, manipulation type, development mode, or sex. The results are consistent with the prediction that early diet restriction disrupts growth and results in increased somatic damage, which incurs lifespan costs. Our findings raise a cautionary note, however, for placing too strong an emphasis on early diet effects on lifespan and highlight limitations of measuring these effects under laboratory conditions. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Various studies have examined associations between maternal vitamin D (VD) deficiency and offspring health, including offspring brain health. The purpose of this review was to summarize current evidence concerning the impact of maternal VD deficiency on brain development and function in offspring. A systematic search was conducted within Medline (on Ovid) for studies published through 7 May 2015. Animal and human studies that examined associations between maternal VD status or developmental VD deficiency and offspring brain development and function were included. A total of 26 animal studies and 10 human studies met the inclusion criteria. Several animal studies confirmed the hypothesis that low prenatal VD status may affect brain morphology and physiology as well as behavioral outcomes. In humans, subtle cognitive and psychological impairments in offspring of VD-deficient mothers were observed. However, data obtained from animal and human studies provide inconclusive evidence, and results seem to depend on strain or race and age of offspring. To conclude, prenatal VD status is thought to play an important role in brain development, cognitive function, and psychological function. However, results are inconclusive; validation of these findings and investigation of underlying mechanisms are required. Thus, more investigation is needed before recommending supplementation of VD during pregnancy to promote brain health of offspring. © 2016 American Society for Nutrition.},

However, the relative magnitude of life-history divergence across selective agents, whether divergence in response to specific selective agents is consistent across taxa and whether it occurs as predicted by theory, remains largely unexplored. We evaluated divergence in offspring size, offspring number, and the trade-off between these traits using a meta-analysis in livebearing fishes (Poeciliidae). Life-history divergence was consistent and predictable to some (predation, hydrogen sulphide) but not all (density, food limitation, salinity) selective agents. In contrast, magnitudes of divergence among selective agents were similar. Finally, there was a negative, asymmetric relationship between offspring-number and offspring-size divergence, suggesting greater costs of increasing offspring size than number. Ultimately, these results provide strong evidence for predictable and consistent patterns of reproductive life-history divergence and highlight the importance of comparing phenotypic divergence across species and ecological selective agents. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

Of the five human studies, one showed a protective effect of folic acid, two showed a harmful effect and two showed uncertain results.CONCLUSIONS:Data from both animal studies and human studies are inconsistent. Future researches with sophisticated designs are needed to demonstrate the potential protective effect of maternal folate on obesity/insulin resistance in the offspring in animal models and human pregnancies. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={Background:There is increasing recognition that maternal effects contribute to variation in individual food intake and metabolism. For example, many experimental studies on model animals have reported the effect of a maternal obesogenic diet during pregnancy on the appetite of offspring. However, the consistency of effects and the causes of variation among studies remain poorly understood.Methods:After a systematic search for relevant publications, we selected 53 studies on rats and mice for a meta-analysis. We extracted and analysed data on the differences in food intake and body weight between offspring of dams fed obesogenic diets and dams fed standard diets during gestation. We used meta-regression to study predictors of the strength and direction of the effect sizes.Results:We found that experimental offspring tended to eat more than control offspring but this difference was small and not statistically significant (0.198, 95% highest posterior density (HPD)=-0.118-0.627). However, offspring from dams on obesogenic diets were significantly heavier than offspring of control dams (0.591, 95% HPD=0.052-1.056). Meta-regression analysis revealed no significant influences of tested predictor variables (for example, use of choice vs no-choice maternal diet, offspring sex) on differences in offspring appetite. Dietary manipulations that extended into lactation had the largest effect on body weight. Subgroup analysis revealed that high protein to non-protein ratio of the maternal diet may promote increased body weight in experimental offspring in comparison with control offspring; low protein content in the maternal chow can have opposite effect.Conclusions:Exposure to maternal obesogenic diets in early life is not likely to result in a substantial change in offspring appetite. Nevertheless, we found an effect on offspring body weight, consistent with permanent alterations of offspring metabolism in response to maternal diet. Additionally, it appears that protein content of the obesogenic diet and timing of manipulation modulate the effects on offspring body weight in later life. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract={The prenatal period is of critical importance in defining how individuals respond to their environment throughout life. Stress experienced by pregnant females has been shown to have detrimental effects on offspring behaviour, health and productivity. The sheep has been used extensively as a model species to inform human studies. However, in the farmed environment, the consequences for the lamb of the imposition of prenatal stresses upon the ewe have received much less attention. The stressors that pregnant ewes are most frequently exposed to include sub-optimal nutrition and those related to housing, husbandry and environment which may be either acute or chronic. A systematic review of the literature was adopted to identify material which had production-relevant maternal stressors and lamb outcomes. The current review focussed upon the lamb up to weaning around the age of 100 days and the results clearly demonstrate that stressors imposed upon the ewe have implications for offspring welfare and performance. Maternal under-nutrition (UN) in the last third of pregnancy consistently impaired lamb birth-weight and subsequent vigour and performance, while earlier UN had a variable effect on performance. Feeding the ewe above requirements did not have positive effects on lamb performance and welfare. Social and husbandry stressors such as transport, shearing, mixing and physiological treatments designed to mimic acute stress which would be considered disadvantageous for the ewe had positive or neutral effects for the lamb, highlighting a potential conflict between the welfare of the ewe and her lamb. This review also identified considerable gaps in knowledge, particularly in respect of the impact of disease upon the ewe during pregnancy and interactions between different stressors and the responses of ewe and lamb. © Cambridge University Press 2014.},

abstract={Maternal undernutrition can result in significant alterations to the post-natal offspring phenotype, including body size and behaviour. For example, maternal food restriction has been implicated in offspring hyperphagia, potentially causing increased weight gain and fat accumulation. This could result in obesity and other adverse long-term health effects in offspring. We investigated the link between maternal caloric restriction during gestation and offspring appetite by conducting the first meta-analysis on this topic using experimental data from mammalian laboratory models (i.e. rats and mice). We collected 89 effect sizes from 35 studies, together with relevant moderators. Our analysis revealed weak and statistically non-significant overall effect on offspring's appetite. However, we found that lower protein content of restricted diets is associated with higher food intake in female offspring. Importantly, we show that a main source of variation among studies arises from whether, and how, food intake was adjusted for body mass. This probably explains many of the contradictory results in the field. Based on our results, we recommend using allometric scaling of food intake to body mass in future studies. © 2014 International Association for the Study of Obesity.},

abstract={The evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity relies on the presence of cues that enable organisms to adjust their phenotype to match local conditions. Although mostly studied with respect to nonsocial cues, it is also possible that parents transmit information about the environment to their offspring. Such 'anticipatory parental effects' or 'adaptive transgenerational plasticity' can have important consequences for the dynamics and adaptive potential of populations in heterogeneous environments. Yet, it remains unknown how widespread this form of plasticity is. Using a meta-analysis of experimental studies with a fully factorial design, we show that there is only weak evidence for higher offspring performance when parental and offspring environments are matched compared with when they are mismatched. Estimates of heterogeneity among studies suggest that effects, when they occur, are subtle. Study features, environmental context, life stage and trait categories all failed to explain significant amounts of variation in effect sizes. We discuss theoretical and methodological reasons for the limited evidence for anticipatory parental effects and suggest ways to improve our understanding of the prevalence of this form of plasticity in nature. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

abstract={The prenatal period is of critical importance in defining how individuals respond to their environment throughout life. Stress experienced by pregnant females has been shown to have detrimental effects on offspring biology in humans and a variety of other species. It also is becoming increasingly apparent that prenatal events can have important consequences for the behavior, health, and productivity of offspring in farmed species. Pregnant cattle may experience many potentially important stressors, for instance, relating to their social environment, housing system and physical environment, interactions with humans and husbandry procedures, and their state of health. We examined the available literature to provide a review of the implications of prenatal stress for offspring welfare in cattle. The long-term effects of dystocia on cattle offspring also are reviewed. To ensure a transparent and repeatable selection process, a systematic review approach was adopted. The research literature clearly demonstrates that prenatal stress and difficult births in beef and dairy cattle both have implications for offspring welfare and performance. Common husbandry practices, such as transport, were shown to influence offspring biology and the importance of environmental variables, including thermal stress and drought, also were highlighted. Maternal disease during pregnancy was shown to negatively impact offspring welfare. Moreover, dystocia-affected calves suffer increased mortality and morbidity, decreased transfer of passive immunity, and important physiological and behavioral changes. This review also identified considerable gaps in our knowledge and understanding of the effects of prenatal stress in cattle. © 2012 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of this systematic review was to collect data concerning the effects of diets containing GM maize, potato, soybean, rice, or triticale on animal health. We examined 12 long-term studies (of more than 90. days, up to 2. years in duration) and 12 multigenerational studies (from 2 to 5 generations). We referenced the 90-day studies on GM feed for which long-term or multigenerational study data were available. Many parameters have been examined using biochemical analyses, histological examination of specific organs, hematology and the detection of transgenic DNA. The statistical findings and methods have been considered from each study. Results from all the 24 studies do not suggest any health hazards and, in general, there were no statistically significant differences within parameters observed. However, some small differences were observed, though these fell within the normal variation range of the considered parameter and thus had no biological or toxicological significance. If required, a 90-day feeding study performed in rodents, according to the OECD Test Guideline, is generally considered sufficient in order to evaluate the health effects of GM feed. The studies reviewed present evidence to show that GM plants are nutritionally equivalent to their non-GM counterparts and can be safely used in food and feed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Objective: Numerous experiments in animals have been performed to investigate the effect of prenatal undernutrition on the development of hypertension in later life, with inconclusive results. We systematically reviewed animal studies examining the effects of maternal undernutrition on SBP, DBP, and mean arterial blood pressure (BP) in offspring. Methods: A search was performed in Medline and Embase to identify articles that reported on maternal undernutrition and hypertension in experimental animal studies. Summary estimates of the effect of undernutrition on SBP, DBP, and mean arterial BP were obtained through meta-analysis. Results: Of the 6151 articles identified, 194 were considered eligible after screening titles and abstracts. After detailed evaluation, 101 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Both maternal general and protein undernutrition increased SBP [general undernutrition: 14.5 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 10.8-18.3; protein undernutrition: 18.9 mmHg, 95% CI 16.1-21.8] and mean arterial BP (general undernutrition: 5.0 mmHg, 95% CI 1.4-8.6; protein undernutrition: 10.5 mmHg, 95% CI 6.7-14.2). There was substantial heterogeneity in the results. DBP was increased by protein undernutrition (9.5 mmHg, 95% CI 2.6-16.3), whereas general undernutrition had no significant effect. Conclusion: The results of this meta-analysis generally support the view that in animals, maternal undernutrition-both general and protein-results in increased SBP and mean arterial BP. DBP was only increased after protein undernutrition. The results depended strongly on the applied measurement technique and animal model. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={The mechanistic link between obese parents and obese offspring and the relative role of genes, and a shared environment is not completely understood. Animal models help us to differentiate between genetic and environmental factors, and the interaction between the two. However, the willingness of researchers to blend results from multiple models makes it difficult for clear mechanisms to be identified for specific hypothesis-driven research. As such we conducted a systematic review of animal models of maternal high fat feeding in an effort to identify the affect on the offspring glycaemic control. Maternal and offspring outcomes are reported in an effort to identify possible relationships to facilitate and focus on future research. We present here data from 11 studies investigating glycaemic control in offspring exposed to a high fat diet (HFD) during maternal gestation only or gestation and lactation. Studies in this review identify a real risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity in male offspring exposed to a maternal HFD. Poor glycaemic control in the offspring appears to be independent of maternal obesity, birth weight or post-weaning macronutrient intake. Inconsistencies between studies however, limit our capacity to identify mechanisms for the developmental origin of these diseases in animal models of overnutrition. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to review the literature on the effects of fetal programming in the inflammatory response in Wistar rats. A search was performed in the following databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, PUBMED, SCIENCE DIRECT, SCOPUS, LILACS, SpringerLink. The main search terms were malnutrition and inflammation in Portuguese and in English. Original articles were included involving albino rats and review articles were excluded involving humans or animals other than rats. Articles that were related to malnutrition which was not intrauterine and did not involve the concept of fetal programming were also excluded. Those items found in more than one database were counted only once. Sixteen articles were found in PUBMED, 16 in SCOPUS, 4 in MEDLINE, 341 in SCIENCE DIRECT, 8 in SciELO, 1 in LILACS and 77 in SPRINGERLINK totalling 463 articles from which 4 were selected for analysis after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fetal programming seems to interfere with the inflammatory response in the adult offspring of Wistar rats, but its mechanisms remain uncertain.},
